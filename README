Chemistry/MacroMol version 0.06
===============================

For the purposes of this module, a macromolecule is just a molecule that 
consists of several "domains". For example, a protein consists of aminoacid
residues, or a nucleic acid consists of bases. Therefore Chemistry::MacroMol 
is derived from Chemistry::Mol, with additional methods to handle the domains.

The way things are currently structured, an atom in a macromolecule "belong"
both to the MacroMol object and to a Domain object. This way you can get all the
atoms in $protein via $protein->atoms, or to the atoms in residue 123 via
$protein->domain(123)->atoms.
